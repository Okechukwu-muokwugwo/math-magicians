      Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations or
      algorithms: it is about understanding
      <cite>  - William Paul Thurston</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will,
      the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection.
      Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction,
      generality and individuality.
      <cite> â€” Richard Courant, German-American mathematician</cite>
